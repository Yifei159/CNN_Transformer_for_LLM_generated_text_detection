# CNN Transformer for LLM Generated Text Detection

This is the source code for the paper 
RESEARCH ON DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHODS FOR
RECOGNIZING TEXT GENERATED BY LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, which is the undergraduate thesis of student Yifei Wei.

## Requirements

The result of this program are based on:

    Operating System: macOS Sequoia (Version 15.0)

    Programming Language: Python 3.10.13 (Coded using Pycharm)

To run this software requires Python 3.8 or higher. To install the dependencies, run::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The main functionality of this software also requires the data.csv
datasets, which is provided by Grinberg Z. Human vs. LLM Text Corpus [Data set]. Kaggle, 2024.
The dataset can be found in:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starblasters8/human-vs-llm-text-corpus/data

Download the data and name it data.csv and put it under the data catalog before running the program.

## Usage

In this section, the various usages are described. Using this software, the
user is able to preprocess the data, including data cleaning,
train the models, generate predictions using the trained model, and evaluate the predictions.

### Training & Evaluation


To train and evaluate the model, run:

    python main.py
